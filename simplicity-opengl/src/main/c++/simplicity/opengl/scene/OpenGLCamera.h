/**
 * <p>
 * A viewpoint within a Scene rendered by a JOGL rendering environment. This implementation uses only simple camera
 * techniques and properties.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The viewing frustum is the shape that contains all components of the Scene displayed when viewing through a
 * SimpleJOGLCamera. The following diagram shows the 'side' and 'front' views of a viewing frustum.
 * </p>
 *

 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Eye</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The eye is the position of the viewer. The 'front' of the frustum in the context of this explanation is the
 * side of the frustum that is closest to the eye. In the 'side' view the eye is shown as the arrow to the left
 * of the frustum.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Near Clipping Plane</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The near clipping plane is a plane in the <code>SceneGraph</code> a distance from the eye in front of which
 * the viewer cannot see i.e. all components of the <code>SceneGraph</code> nearer to the eye than the near
 * clipping plane will be clipped (not drawn). The area on the near clipping plane that constitutes a face of
 * the frustum is shown as the short vertical line in the 'side' view and the smaller rectangle in the 'front'
 * view. This face can be thought of as analogous to the screen and is referred to as the frame.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Far Clipping Plane</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The far clipping plane is a plane in the <code>SceneGraph</code> a distance from the eye past which the
 * viewer cannot see i.e. all components of the <code>SceneGraph</code> further from the eye than the far
 * clipping plane will be clipped (not drawn). The area on the far clipping plane that constitutes a face of the
 * frustum is shown as the long vertical line in the 'side' view and the larger rectangle in the 'front' view.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Frame Position and Dimensions</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The dimensions of the areas of the clipping planes that are used as faces of the frustum are calculated
 * automatically by the <code>SimpleJOGLCamera</code>. The diagonal lines in the diagram extend from the four
 * corners of the far clipping plane to the four corners of the near clipping plane and finally (by default)
 * converge at the eye. The frame can be moved on the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axis so that the eye no
 * longer resides at this convergence. Also, the aspect ratio of the frame (4:3 by default) can be changed.
 * </p>
